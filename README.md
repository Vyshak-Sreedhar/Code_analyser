# Code Performance Analyzer

## Overview
The **Code Performance Analyzer** is a web-based tool designed to identify potential performance bottlenecks in Python code snippets. It uses static analysis to detect inefficiencies and provides suggestions for optimization. This tool is perfect for developers who want quick feedback on their code's performance characteristics.

---

## Features

- **Identify Performance Bottlenecks**  
  Detect common inefficiencies like nested loops and sorting operations.

- **Optimization Suggestions**  
  Receive actionable advice on improving code performance.

- **User-Friendly Interface**  
  A simple web interface to paste code, analyze it, and view results.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.9+**
- **Flask**: Backend framework for building the web application.
- **HTML/CSS**: For a basic and clean user interface.
- **Python ast Module**: For static code analysis.

Design Choices
Static Analysis Using ast
The ast module provides a lightweight, static analysis mechanism to parse and analyze Python code without executing it.

Flask Framework
Flask was chosen for its simplicity and flexibility, making it ideal for a small-scale project like this.

Minimal User Interface
A clean and functional UI ensures users can focus on the tool's functionality.

Assumptions and Limitations
Assumptions
The input is valid Python code.
The tool only analyzes Python code snippets (not other languages).
Limitations
Does not analyze runtime performance (e.g., execution time or memory usage).
Limited to detecting nested loops and sorting operations.
Syntax errors in the code will result in an invalid analysis.
Future Improvements
Add support for runtime profiling to measure execution time and memory usage.
Expand detection to include more performance issues like unnecessary data copies, suboptimal library usage, etc.
Enhance the UI with better styling and user experience.

### Key Formatting Improvements:
1. **Headings**: I've used headings to clearly separate the sections.
2. **Code Blocks**: Used inline and fenced code blocks for commands and directory structure for better readability.
3. **Bullet Points**: The features and requirements are listed with bullet points for clarity.
4. **Screenshots**: Placeholder for images to show the home and results pages, enhancing visual appeal.
5. **Emphasis**: Important sections like "License", "Contact", and "Contributing" are clearly defined.
